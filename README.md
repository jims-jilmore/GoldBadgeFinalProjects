Feels like the biggest challenge was dealing with myself. Especially in the Cafe project I was trying to do far too much.
Was overthinking the project and how to go about dealing with certain things. Figured it out pretty quick how important it 
was to break down things to the simplest logic possible. The projects overall started out fairly slow. It wasn't until a 
couple days in that thing felt like they started clicking and I started making some big leaps.
